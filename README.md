This is the repository of Oasis Infobyte. I have uploaded my project here as I am a Data Science intern at this company
I have made three projects for the internship
- Car Price Prediction
- Spam Email Detection
- Unemployment Analysis

### About the Company

*OASIS INFOBYTE* is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. 
*OASIS INFOBYTE* is all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering of shared interests. We develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and wellbeing.

### Car Price Prediction

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. *Car price prediction* is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So I want to learn how to train a car price prediction model and I have made this project.

### Spam Email Prediction

Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project, I have used *Python* to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.

### Unemployment Analysis

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project. I have made *Unemployment analysis project* using python and machine learning model
